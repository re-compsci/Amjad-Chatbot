# Amjad-Chatbot

An Arabic chatbot, is a program that can understand and respond in
Arabic. Nowadays, people need to interact and express their experiences
and problems on a friendly, smart platform that understands them.
A chatbot would do that by analyzing their feelings, emotional needs,
and problems according to their situation. Arabic chatbot is not as
effective as it should be and is not widely used, so there is an opportunity
to develop technical methods using Arabic to solve the problem of the
social and emotional aspect by using chatbots to increase psychological
awareness by having an emphasis conversation with the user and
making them feel comfortable to communicate with.
